This is the README file for the uBOOT - a bootloader for the uDMX USB-DMX Interfaceversion 1.2----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like the uDMX, uBOOT is based on the open source firmware only usb driver byObjective Development. It shares the same hardware  with the uDMX...Please see the Readme.txt file for the uDMX for details about licensing and more details----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BASIC DESCRIPTIONThe uBOOT is a Bootloader application residing in the last 2k of the AVRs application flash memory with it's own usb driver.If you set the AVR fuse bits  to 0xc8, 0xef: 	 	cd /udMX/sources/bootloader/firmware	make fusethe Boot-Reset fuse gets set, so every time the AVR is powered up it jumps to the Bootloader address (1800) instead of the main program (0000).There we check if the jumper is set, or if a "soft jumper" is set in the EEPROM.If not, we jump to the main application, and the device initializes itself asa uDMX USB-DMX interface.The uDMX command line tool version 1.2 introduces the -bootloader option to set the soft jumper, as in	./udmx -bootloaderIf one of the above jumpers are set, the device starts the bootloaderinstead of the main application on power up and connects to the host computer as "uBOOT".Now we can start talking to the device using the uboot commandline tool:	./uboot -upload file_to_upload.hex    upload hex file  	./uboot -clear_flag          		  clear softjumper  	./uboot -leave                        leave bootloader and start applicationIt might be wise to check the uploaded program first (just -leave), before clearing the soft jumperbecause if it is corrupted it won't be able to set the soft jumper anymore, no way to evercall the bootloader again, and you've locked yourself out of the (not functioning) device...------------------------INSTALLATIONMake the uBOOT firmware and flash it to the device first	cd bootloader/firmware/	make	make fuse	make flash	Then you can either upload the uDMX.hex file using the ./uboot command line tool, or flashthe hex file as usual with uisp, for example. Just make sure you don't use the --erase option, this would erase your bootloader...	------------------------MORE INFORMATIONFor more information about uDMX please visit 	http://www.anyma.ch/research/udmx/ 	or contact research@anyma.chFor more information about Objective Development's firmware-only USB driverfor Atmel's AVR microcontrollers please visit the URL    http://www.obdev.at/products/avrusb/A technical documentation of the driver's interface can be found in the file"firmware/usbdrv/usbdrv.h".uDMX is (c) 2006 [ a n y m a ], developed by Max & Michael Eggeravrusb is (c) 2005, 2006 by OBJECTIVE DEVELOPMENT Software GmbH.http://www.obdev.at/
